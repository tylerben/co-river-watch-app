    name: "Arkansas River",
    description: `At 168,000 square miles, the Arkansas River Basin is one of the largest in Colorado. It is responsible for draining the entire southeast quarter of the state. The Arkansas River begins in the very center of Colorado, near Leadville, the highest city in the United States. Like other Colorado Rivers, it can thank the generous snowfall of the Rockies for its headwaters.

      The river begins its journey across four states as a steep, quick-moving mountain river cutting through the narrow Arkansas River Valley. This portion of the river is famed for its flyfishing and whitewater rafting. Originally home to many greenback cutthroat trout, these waters are now dominated by brown trout and rainbow trout. As the river makes its way through Buena Vista and Salida, fly shops and their fisherman line the banks while adventure companies guide their guests over rapids.
      
      The Arkansas continues its southeastern path through Colorado, carving canyons here and there. Brown’s canyon, a popular rafting destination near Salida, is a freshly created national monument designated by President Obama in 2015. The monument protects 21,586 acres of pristine wilderness along the Arkansas River. As the river nears Cañon City, a more well-known canyon rises up: the Royal Gorge. Through persistent erosion of hard granite walls, the Arkansas River has cut a gap in the earth up to 1,250 feet deep, yet only 50-300 feet wide. Spanning the gorge is one of the world’s highest suspension bridges. Tourists walking across the bridge get a thrill out of peering through the slats beneath their feet as the river passes by 955 feet below.
      
      The land has flattened out now. Accordingly, as it leaves Cañon City, the river also flattens out. Like other Great Plains rivers, its banks become wide and shallow and are prone to seasonal flooding. The next city through which the Arkansas passes is Pueblo, a town of over 100,000. Pueblo is built upon a desert and, like many western cities, wouldn’t exist without its river.
      
      The Arkansas is joined by the Purgatoire River at Las Animas before it crosses the state line into Kansas. Kansas is rumored to be the flattest state in the nation. It is also the most agriculturally productive. As such, the river meanders this way and that, almost whimsically, providing irrigation to vast farmlands as it goes.
      
      The river now enters Oklahoma. Here, it receives water from some major tributaries: the Cimarron River near Tulsa, the Neosho River near Muskogee, and the Canadian River before crossing the state line into Arkansas. Below Muskogee, the river is navigable by commercial barges and other river craft. This is made possible by the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System, a series of locks and dams on the river that was completed in 1971. These dams and locks have converted a naturally modest, shallow river into a series of deeper reservoirs that are capable of supporting large amounts of river traffic.
      
      Fort Smith marks the border between Oklahoma and Arkansas, and also the starting line for the river’s final sprint. As it flows through the state for which it was named, the river nurtures dense forest growth along its banks. Finally, the Arkansas itself now acts as a tributary as it empties into the mighty Mississippi River.`,

    name: "Colorado River",
    description: `The Colorado River is one of the arid American West’s most important suppliers of water. Its basin drains an area roughly the size of France and provides water to seven states in the US – Wyoming, Colorado, California, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona – as well as two states in Mexico.

      The Colorado River itself has humble beginnings as billions of snow flakes, high up in the Rocky Mountains near La Poudre Pass. The headwaters of the Colorado are primarily formed by the melting of this snow. This young, creek-like Colorado cascades down the western side of the continental divide, where it is fed by the Blue River near Kremmling and the Eagle River near Eagle. On its way to its meeting with the cold Roaring Fork River, the Colorado carves away at the crumbly and beautiful Glenwood Canyon. As it passes through Glenwood, it’s not uncommon to see a kayaker or even a surfer atop the man-made wave near Dairy Queen.
      
      The Colorado, now moving at a slower pace and colored by the sediment for which it was named, meanders along western Colorado, through tiny towns built around the river, like New Castle, Rifle, Parachute, and De Beque. After passing through the long and twisting De Beque Canyon, the river joins up with another large river, the Gunnison, in the aptly-named city of Grand Junction. Here, the river provides water for lazy canyon rafting and hot-weather wineries.
      
      As it exits the state of its birth, the Colorado River enters a region known as the Colorado Plateau. This area is dominated by uplifted sandstone and slickrock. Like an eccentric architect, the river sculpts canyons, arches, and hoodoos out of the rock. The river is bolstered by water from the Dolores River as well as a major addition from the Green River on its way to one of its largest obstacles, the Glen Canyon Dam. The dam, built in 1966, holds back nearly two years worth of the river’s normal flow in the form of Lake Powell. The lake is popular for boaters, and owes its twisting sandstone beauty to the canyon that it covers. As the river flows out of the lake and through the dam, it generates a large amount of hydroelectric power.
      
      Below Lake Powell, the river flows through what may be its greatest achievement: the Grand Canyon. Over millions of years, the powerful Colorado has carved a gorge into the earth nearly one mile deep and 277 miles long.
      
      The river then makes a quick side-trip through Nevada. While the time it spends in Nevada may be just a blip in the river’s radar, the water it provides to Lake Mead, contained by the massive Hoover Dam, provides water for almost the entire city of Las Vegas. Below its two major reservoirs, the Colorado loses much of its red-brown color due to massive sediment deposition.
      
      The now bluish-green river continues in a markedly south-ward path, forming the border between Arizona and California. At this point nearly all of what remains of the Colorado is diverted either to supply the many large cities in Arizona’s desert or to fill the All-American Canal, a main water source for California’s agricultural Imperial Valley.
      
      The remnants of the river trickle through Mexico, toward their final destination in the Gulf of California. Occasionally, the river receives a small boost from the Gila River near Yuma, but much of this water is then used to irrigate the fields of the Mexicali Valley. Often, the entirety of the river will be used up before reaching the ocean, and then small amounts will re-emerge nearer to the coast in the form of irrigation return flows.
      
      1,450 miles from its origin, the Colorado finally meets the Gulf of California. Since 1960, the Colorado River has made it all the way to the Gulf only a handful of times. The Colorado River Delta, an ecologically valuable estuary, now gets most of its water from the much smaller and shorter Hardy River.`,

    name: "Gunnison River",
    description: `The Gunnison River Basin is one of the smaller river basins in Colorado listed on this site. In fact, it is the only one of our study basins to be entirely contained within the state. However, that doesn’t make it any less important: the Gunnison River is the Colorado River’s largest in-state tributary.

    The confluence of the East River and the Taylor River in Almont, CO marks the official starting point of the Gunnison River. As it passes through the town of Gunnison, the river swells to something a little more river-sized right before it flows in to the largest standing body of water in Colorado, Blue Mesa Reservoir.
    
    Blue Mesa Reservoir, like Lake Powell, is actually the flooded upper portion of a canyon. In this case, the flooded canyon is the Black Canyon. Thanks to the canyon, the reservoir is surrounded by dramatic cliffs and spires whose beauty attracts nearly 1 million boaters and fishermen each year. One of the Gunnison’s major tributaries, Lake Fork, flows into the reservoir and adds its volume to the river.
    
    Two more dams and two more reservoirs, Morrow Point Reservoir and Crystal Reservoir, exist on this upper portion of the Black Canyon. These three dam/reservoir systems combined provide hydroelectric power and irrigation water to the area.
    
    Below Crystal Reservoir, the Gunnison picks up speed and practically roars through its most famous feature, the Black Canyon of the Gunnison. The Black Canyon is so named because of its combination of extreme depth and narrowness, making it appear black; it’s rumored that some parts of the gorge only receive thirty-three minutes of sunlight each day. The river travels through the canyon at an unusually steep grade. When factored in with large boulders that split the river and rocky portages around obstacles, this stretch of the Gunnison has been deemed impassable to all but the most experienced kayakers and rafters. However, this part of the Gunnison is also a gold medal trout fishery, and many a fisherman are willing to suffer the inconvenience to get their hands on a monster brown or rainbow trout.
    
    After exiting the beautiful Black Canyon, the Gunnison River continues through the high desert of western Colorado. At the town of Delta, the river is joined by the Uncompaghre River. Delta itself used to be an old Ute trading post, and is named after the delta it was situated on at the mouth of the Uncompaghre where it emptied into the Gunnison.
    
    Before reaching its final destination, the Gunnison commits one more act of beauty as it carves away at the Dominguez-Escalante canyon system. A relatively unknown area almost invisible from nearby Highway 50, Dominguez-Escalante Canyon is a lovely, branching corridor of red sandstone and sunshine. It offers miles of hiking, a few waterfalls, and many Ute petroglyphs.
    
    Finally, the Gunnison River reaches its journey’s end in Grand Junction. And a grand junction it is indeed as the Gunnison dumps its contents into a river it often rivals in size, the Colorado.`,

    name: "North Platte River",
    description: `The North Platte River basin is the smallest river basin in Colorado – it covers only a 2,050-square-mile blip at the northern border of the state. This is because, true to its reputation as the “headwater state”, Colorado contains just the headwaters of the South Platte River. The remaining 30,000 square miles of the basin stretch across two other states, Wyoming and Nebraska.

      Though it would be convenient, this tiny portion of the North Platte basin isn’t grouped together with that of the South Platte because it truly is separate. The headwaters of the North Platte River are actually a myriad of mountain streams flowing to the center of North Park, a large, high, intermontane basin surrounded by 12,000-foot-high peaks. The North and South Platte couldn’t share a river basin if they wanted to.
      
      This headwater region of the North Platte is relatively unspoiled. Wildife, such as trout, moose, deer, elk, and bears, are plentiful while people are not; the largest town in North Park has a whopping 608 citizens. Other small, unincorporated towns are sprinkled throughout the region, but wilderness areas and national forest dominate.
      
      As trickles come together to form streams, and streams come together to form creeks, a main stem of water arises and passes through the aforementioned largest town, Walden, CO. Beyond Walden, this swift, narrow version of the river flows north and provides irrigation and municipal water to the 2,000 people that inhabit Jackson County. A short while later, the North Platte’s time in Colorado comes to an end as it passes through Northgate Canyon, its passageway to Wyoming.
      
      Northgate Canyon contains a 9.8-mile stretch of whitewater that is a favorite of rafters and fisherman. Though it can be a bit difficult to access, this portion of the river provides top-notch angling opportunities for trout. The 20-foot/mile gradient also provides rafters with some exciting class III+ rapids, such as the charmingly named Windy Hole, Cowpie, Narrow Falls, and Tootsie Roll. As the river continues north into Wyoming, it meets up with the Medicine Bow River at Seminoe Reservoir and the Sweetwater River at Pathfinder Reservoir. Five more major dams await the river on its path through Wyoming and Nebraska, all part of an effort to store irrigation water for the semi-arid Midwest.
      
      Just past Casper, Wyoming, the river exits the mountains and curves southeast toward the plains. It morphs from swift and narrow to shallow and braiding, and is joined by the Laramie River before entering Nebraska. This relatively straight portion of the river from Casper all the way down into Nebraska formed a portion of historic westward expansion trails, including the Oregon Trail, the Bozeman Trail, and the Mormon Trail. Pioneers often used rivers as guidance for trails; they provided water, grass for livestock, and directional orientation.
      
      A good distance into Nebraska, about nine miles north of Ogallala, the North Platte is impounded by the Kingsley Dam to form Lake McConaughy. At 22 miles long, 4 miles wide (at the widest point), and 142 feet deep near the dam, Lake McConaughy is by far the largest reservoir in Nebraska. Besides hydroelectric power and massive amounts of irrigation water, the lake offers recreational opportunities like fishing, boating, camping, and hunting in an otherwise flat, semi-arid land devoted to agriculture.
      
      Below Lake McConaughy, the North Platte flows nearly parallel to South Platte for nearly fifty miles – at times the two rivers are only five miles apart. According to written records and imprints from old streambeds, this portion of the North Platte River used to be up to a mile wide. Today, irrigation diversions have reduced it to a shadow of its former self. However, the North Platte still contributes more water than its companion the South Platte, whose water is used to supply the populous Front Range region of Colorado. At the aptly-named town of North Platte, the North Platte River joins with the South Platte, and together they create Nebraska’s beloved Platte River.`,

    name: "South Platte River",
    description: `Eighty percent of Colorado’s water flows west of the Great Divide, yet eighty percent of the population lives on the east side of the state. So where do the millions of Front Range inhabitants get their water? The majority of it comes from the unsuspecting South Platte River.

      The South Platte originates in the Mosquito range near Fairplay, Colorado. Melting snow accumulates in many small ponds, whose water then trickles down to form the North Fork and Middle Fork; the confluence of these two streams marks the beginning of the South Platte River. The young river quickly descends through mountains and foothills. Along the way, it is impounded by seven dams and seven reservoirs. Oddly enough, it is this system of dams and reservoirs that grants the South Platte the conditions for excellent trout fishing. This part of the river is known as a “tailwater fishery”. Tailwater is a term used to describe outflow from a dam; in this case, the water usually flows from the bottom of the dam, accessing the cold, relatively sediment-free water from the bottom of its reservoir. The year-round flow of this cold water into the river supports a robust cold-water fish population in a place they might not normally thrive.
      
      The last of these dams is located at Chatfield Reservoir, just south of Denver proper. This major dam is a main storage facility for Denver’s drinking water. Believe it or not, Chatfield reservoir was built in response to a major flood on the usually docile South Platte in 1965 – 21 people died, thousands of homes were damaged, and many roads and bridges had to be rebuilt. The top of Chatfield’s dam is approximately 100 feet higher than the current surface the reservoir and provides mitigation if a flood of such magnitude were to happen again.
      
      Below Chatfield Reservoir, the South Platte continues on a northeasterly path through the heart of Denver, where it joins forces with Cherry Creek. This confluence is actually where the city of Denver was originally established. Unfortunately, this section of river is also the most used and abused of the South Platte’s waters. For over a century as the city grew up around it, the water here was utilized for industries that had poor waste management strategies and would dump their water back into the river via discharge pipes. The South Platte is currently on the EPA’s list of impaired waters due to higher levels of E. coli, a bacterium that indicates the presence of other harmful pollution, and the occurrence of New Zealand Mud Snails and Zebra Mussels, both invasive species of aquatic mollusks.
      
      However, things are looking up for the South Platte. In recent decades, concerted efforts have been put forth by Denver conservationists to revive the river. Bike paths and riverside parks have been built along its banks in order to strengthen the local community’s connection with their river. Businesses that utilize the river and its tributaries must follow stringent guidelines created by the Clean Water Act. And there are plans to begin allowing a set, annual amount of water out of Chatfield reservoir to bolster the river during times of low flow; this extra water will maintain curves and pools that will allow aquatic insects to thrive and fish to spawn naturally.
      
      The river continues toward the northern Denver-Metro area. Here, Clear Creek adds its waters to the South Platte’s flow. As the river passes through Greeley, it also gains water from Saint Vrain Creek and the Little Thompson, Big Thompson, and Cache la Poudre Rivers. All this water will be important because from this point forward, the South Platte becomes a Great Plains river, and its main purpose will be providing water for agriculture. Colorado farmers irrigate from the South Platte as it passes through Fort Morgan and Stirling, all the way until it reaches the state line (or state corner, more appropriately) at Julesberg, Colorado. Here it passes into Nebraska, where it soon meets up with the North Platte River to form Nebraska’s agricultural workhorse, the Platte River.`,

    name: "Rio Grande River",
    description: `The Rio Grande river basin doesn’t get much attention in Colorado. It only spends a very small portion of its journey in the state. However, with a river basin that drains 182,000 square miles of land (that’s 11% of the continental U.S.!), the Rio Grande is not a river to be ignored. Originally the Rio Grande (meaning “large river”) was known as El Rio Bravo (the “ferocious/wild river”), a name given it by the first Spanish explorers. Though the river still retains its original name in Mexico, it is now neither ferocious nor wild. In fact, excepting a few stretches where rafting is possible, the river averages ten feet in depth and is downright tame. So what happened to this once mighty river? The answers can be found as we follow its course through some of the most drought-prone land in the United States.

      The Rio Grande begins as a joining of several streams at the base of Canby Mountain, high up in the San Juan Mountains of southern Colorado. As a small river, it makes its way down through the mountains and across the San Luis Valley. Along with water from underground aquifers, the Rio Grande helps to irrigate the potato, head lettuce, and barley crops of towns like Del Norte, Monte Vista, and Alamosa (fun fact: Coors gets the majority of its barley from these crops!) The river also provides these towns with excellent fishing and small-craft rafting opportunities. The Valley uses so much of the river’s water that by the time it exits the state, 95% of the Upper Rio Grande’s water has already been diverted for irrigation.
      
      As the river enters New Mexico, it becomes boxed in by the high walls of the Rio Grande rift, a natural seismic separation of the earth’s crust. The first part of this rift, near Taos, New Mexico, forms the breathtaking Rio Grande Gorge. At 800 feet deep and approximately 50 miles long, the gorge hides away many jewels: ancient ruins, petroglyphs, and hotsprings. The gorge is actually part of a larger park, Rio Grande del Norte National Monument. The park was dedicated in 2013 in order to preserve cultural relics, prime bird habitat, dramatic wilderness, and a beautiful whitewater stretch of river.
      
      Shortly after Taos, the Rio Grande is joined by the Chama River at Española and the Puerco River after Albuquerque. Past Albuquerque, the river is impounded by its largest obstacle, the Elephant Butte dam. Named after an elephant-shaped volcanic core that is now an island in Elephant Butte Reservoir, the 300-foot-tall dam holds back water used for agriculture, recreation, and hydroelectricity. Unfortunately, the dam has also reduced the river’s flow downstream to a mere trickle.
      
      Users continue to draw from the river until it reaches El Paso, Texas. “Reach” is euphemistic word: no water has consistently flowed past El Paso, Texas since 1916. This stretch of river, from El Paso to the river’s confluence with the Rio Conchos, is known as the “Forgotten Reach”. When Texas and Mexico divvied up the waters of the river they share, their priority was agriculture, and this section of the river was “forgotten”. Today, people who endeavor to travel the river’s length have to pick up their boats and walk 200 miles. Environmental organizations are currently looking into how this “dead” section of river can be restored.
      
      Luckily for those downstream, the Rio Grande’s flow is replenished by the entrance of the Rio Conchos at Presidio, TX/Ojinaga, Mexico. In a way, it is odd that the river continues to be called the Rio Grande, since nearly all of its water is actually water from the Rio Conchos. Regardless, the river moves on, forming the natural border between Mexico and Texas. Along the way, it also forms another natural wonder: Big Bend National Park. A plethora of ancient artifacts and animal species call this park’s deep canyon and 800,000 acres of desert wilderness home.
      
      The river continues on its journey to the Gulf of Mexico. Its banks are flanked by pairs of cites – one on the Mexico side and one on the Texas side of the river. Allocation of the river’s waters, already a hairy process, is further complicated by the fact that this river is shared by two different countries. Before reaching the sea, the Salado and San Juan Rivers add their waters to the main stem in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas.
      
      1,900 miles from its source, near Brownsville, TX/Matamoros, Mexico, the Rio Grande reaches the Gulf of Mexico. The river did not make it all the way to the sea in 2001 and 2002 due to low flows and a large sandbar. However, unlike its sister river the Colorado, the Rio Grande does still consistently flow all the way to the ocean.`,

    name: "San Juan/San Miguel/Dolores Rivers",
    description: `The three major rivers that form this drainage basin begin in what is possibly the most scenic part of Colorado: the San Juan Mountains. This range is tall, jagged, and highly mineralized with gold, silver, aluminum, copper, lead, and other valuable metals. As such, the rivers running through this region have faced many challenges over the last two centuries due to the heavy mining activity that first brought settlers to the area.

      The San Juan River begins in its namesake mountains near Pagosa Springs, CO. Only a short portion of the San Juan’s 383-mile journey is spent in Colorado; it quickly moves south and exits the state, loops through New Mexico, crosses the very southwestern tip of Colorado, and the moves into Utah. While in Colorado, the river is joined by one of its main tributaries, the Piedra River. Almost directly after, the San Juan crosses the sate border and flows into Navajo Lake. Oddly enough, the dam that forms Navajo Lake actually creates ideal conditions for the “Miracle Mile”, a renowned trout fishery right below the reservoir.
      
      Near Farmington, the river meets the Animas. Recently, the Animas has become famous for a dramatic mine water spill that turned the river orange. Effects of the spill on the Animas and the San Juan are still being measured, but so far, damage to the rivers’ wild inhabitants isn’t as bad as was initially thought.
      
      From Farmington, the river continues on its path through New Mexico, where it provides water for much of the Navajo Reservation, on through southwestern Colorado, and into Utah. It finally feeds into the Colorado River at Lake Powell. In fact, the San Juan forms the largest arm off of the main body of the reservoir.
      
      North of the San Juan, on either side of Lizard Head Pass near Telluride, the San Miguel and Dolores rivers begin their route down through the mountains. The San Miguel descends steeply and then mellows as it passes through small towns like Placerville and Nucla. The Dolores takes a more remote path, winding through a large wilderness study area and carving the beautiful Dolores River Canyon.
      
      Before crossing the western state line, the Dolores and San Miguel come together. Technically, the San Miguel is a tributary of the Dolores. However, many diversions on the Dolores often cause it to be smaller than its tributary. Now one river, the Dolores flows into Utah, where it adds its waters to the Colorado River just north of Moab.`,

    name: "Yampa/White/Green Rivers",
    description: `This three-river drainage basin covers in equal part portions of Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah. The Yampa and White Rivers are contained almost entirely within Colorado and are technically part of the larger Green River drainage area, but alone they drain a significant area of northwestern Colorado, and so are still of considerable importance.

      The largest of the three rivers, the Green, begins in the scenic Wind River Mountains in Wyoming, as glacial water that seeps and collects into high-mountain ponds and streams. From here, the Green River flows south through Wyoming’s Green River Valley until it reaches Flaming Gorge Reservoir on the Wyoming-Utah border. A barrier formed by Utah’s Uintah Mountains forces the river to veer from its southward path and loop east into western Colorado. During its 40-mile jaunt into Colorado, the now large and deep Green continues its etchings into the sandstone as it moves through Browns Canyon and Dinosaur National Monument.
      
      As quickly as it enters Colorado, the Green River exits. The Yampa River adds its waters at Steamboat Rock right before the Green reaches the Utah state line. As it continues to force its way through deep troughs in the Colorado Plateau, the Green River is joined by the White River just south of Ouray, Utah. Notable of these troughs is Desolation Canyon and Gray Canyon, the latter of which joins the Price River with the Green. The river then passes through Green River, Utah, a town less known for its namesake river than its travel stops and delicious melons. Finally, the Green reaches its final destination and most awe-inspiring carving, Canyonlands National Park. Together with the Colorado River, the Green has eroded away at layers of elevated rock to create a colorful and primitive maze of canyons, buttes, and mesas. It is here that the Green spills into the Colorado River. The Green River is sometimes as large as the Colorado and carries a heavier sediment load. The confluence between the two rivers is often visible as a distinct, immiscible line: the light brown Green stays to one side and the darker blue-green Colorado stays to the other until currents force the rivers together downstream.
      
      The Yampa River is one of the Green River’s larger tributaries; alone, it drains an area of 7,660 square miles in northwestern Colorado and a small part of Wyoming. The Yampa officially begins at the convergence of Bear River and Williams Creek near the town of Yampa, Colorado, located in the mountains of the Park Range. From here it meanders north, takes a sharp left turn at Steamboat Springs, and continues its curved path west through Hayden, Craig, and a large stretch of sparsely populated scrubland.
      
      Along the way, the river maintains a shallow, dancing, and braided character. This is because the Yampa is one of the few free-flowing rivers left in the United States – it is unimpeded by anything except a few insignificant dams and diversions that do little to disrupt its natural flow. As such, the flow is variable and entirely dependent on seasonal snowmelt and rainfall; during the winter, flows can be so low that the upper reaches of the river ice over completely. This natural flow also supports riparian vegetation and aquatic wildlife that has been lost on other Colorado waterways. The Yampa River Preserve, 17 miles west of steamboat, is an example of this. The broad floodplain here provides conditions for a rare combination of steam-side vegetation, as well as for bald eagles, the Colorado pikeminnow, and the humpback chub.
      
      As the Yampa nears the Utah border, it slices a 1,000-foot gorge through Cross Mountain and adds its erosive force to the rugged canyons near Dinosaur National Monument. In Echo Canyon, the river converges with Green River.
      
      Just west of the Yampa’s headwaters, two forks come together in the Flat Tops Wilderness, part of White River National Forest, to form the beginning of the White River. The convergence officially occurs near Buford, Colorado, a tiny town that probably only continues to exist because of its quaint country store and the presence of this sport-fishing river. The river heads northwest then bends southwest as it passes through small western Colorado towns such as Meeker and Rangely.
      
      The White River is one of the few places in the state you can find solitude as you fish or raft – its 5,120 square-mile drainage basin is beautiful, but sparsely populated. Piceance Creek, Yellow Creek, and Rangely Creek add their waters to the White’s flow before it meets up with Green River two miles south of Ouray, Utah. `,
